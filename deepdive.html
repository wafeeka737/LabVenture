      <h3>Why Ice Floats</h3>
      <p>Ice floats because water expands when it freezes, creating a crystal structure that is less dense than liquid water. This is why ice forms on the surface of lakes and ponds, while the water below remains liquid, allowing fish and other aquatic life to survive during winter.</p>

      <h3>Making Perfume</h3>
      <p>Perfumes are made by blending essential oils (top, middle, and base notes) with carriers and solvents.
Top notes are the first scents you smell, like citrus or mint. Middle notes form the main character of the fragrance, such as lavender or rose. Base notes are long-lasting, like woods, vanilla or musk.
Understanding ratios and scent profiles is key to creating your fragrance.</p>

      <h3>Elephant Toothpaste</h3>
      <p>Elephant toothpaste happens when hydrogen peroxide reacts with a catalyst (like potassium iodide), producing oxygen gas. The gas gets trapped in soap, creating a huge, foamy eruption that demonstrates a fun chemical reaction.</p>
